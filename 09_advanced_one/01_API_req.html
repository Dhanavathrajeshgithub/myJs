    XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can
    retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This
    enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the
    user is doing.

    <p>
      The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest
      client is in. An XHR client exists in one of the following states: 
      <p>Value   State Description </p>
      <p>0       UNSENT Client has been created. open() not called yet.</p>
      <p>1       OPENED open() has been called. </p>
      <p>2       HEADERS_RECEIVED send() has been called, and headers and status are available. </p>
      <p>3       LOADING Downloading; responseText holds partial data. </p>
      <p>4       DONE The operation is complete.</p>
    </p>
